# Code output

The first time you run the code, some outputs that take a long time to produce will be saved in this folder. This way, you won't have to rerun those sections of the code every time. If you don't want to use the already-saved outputs, you can either delete the files in this folder or skip the lines in the R code that check for previously created outputs.
