# Trichogramma_POL_dispersal_2023

This repo contains data and code needed to perform the analyses and figures in: "Life history traits, pace-of-life and dispersal among and within five species of *Trichogramma* wasps: a comparative analysis" (by Chloé Guicharnaud, Géraldine Groussier, Erwan Beranger, Laurent Lamy, Maxime Dahirel & Elodie Vercken)

The code relies on the `here` package to ensure relative file paths just work, independently of the computer.

If you run the script for the first time, time-consuming outputs like models will be saved in the R_output folder so you don't have to re-run them everytime.
