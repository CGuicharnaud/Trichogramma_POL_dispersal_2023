This repository contains data and code needed to perform the analyses and figures in: "Life-history traits, pace of life and dispersal among and within five species of *Trichogramma* wasps: a comparative analysis" (by Chloé Guicharnaud, Géraldine Groussier, Erwan Beranger, Laurent Lamy, Maxime Dahirel & Elodie Vercken)
(link to the bioRxiv preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.24.525360)

The code relies on the `here` package to ensure relative file paths just work, independently of the computer.

If you run the script for the first time, time-consuming outputs like models will be saved in the `R_output` folder so you don't have to re-run them everytime.
